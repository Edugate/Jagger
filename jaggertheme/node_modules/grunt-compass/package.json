  "readme": "# THIS GRUNT PLUGIN IS DEPRECATED SINCE THE RELEASE OF GRUNT.JS v0.4.0.\n\n# PLEASE USE [`grunt-contrib-compass`](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compass) FROM NOW ON.\n\n-----\n\n# grunt-compass [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kahlil/grunt-compass.png)](http://travis-ci.org/kahlil/grunt-compass)\n\nThis is a custom grunt.js multitask aka [gruntplugin](http://jsfiddle.net/cowboy/qzRjD/show/) that executes `compass compile` on the command line for you and prints the COMPASS output to `grunt.log.write()`.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nYou need to have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [grunt.js](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt), [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) installed for this to work.\n\n## Installation & Options\n\n1. Install this grunt plugin next to your project's grunt.js gruntfile with: `npm install grunt-compass`.\n2. Call `grunt.loadNpmTasks( 'grunt-compass' )` in your gruntfile.\n3. Configure `grunt watch` to watch your scss files and call the task(s).\n\te.g.:\n\n\t```javascript\n\twatch: {\n\t    files: [ 'assets/scss/*.scss' ],\n\t    tasks: [ 'compass:dev', 'compass:prod' ]\n\t}\n\t```\n\n4. Setup your SASS and CSS paths\n\n\t```javascript\n    src: 'assets/scss',\n    dest: 'assets/css'\n\t```\n\n\t`src` is the folder with sass or scss files and `dest` is the folder where the css files will be placed.\n\n5. Use `specify` to specify certain files you want to compile:\n\n    A single file.\n\n    ```javascript\n    specify: 'assets/scss/base.scss'\n    ```\n\n    Use globbing to match files, like:\n\n    ```javascript\n    specify: 'assets/scss/*.scss' // Match all scss files under `assets/scss` but not include files in subdirctory.\n    specify: 'assets/scss/**/*.scss' // Match all scss files under `assets/scss` include files in subdirctory.\n    ```\n\n    See [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) for more globbing usage.\n\n    Note a SASS/SCSS file will be ignored if its filename begin with an underscore `_`. And all files you specify **MUST** be under the directory that you specified with `src`.\n\n    See [SASS-partials](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#partials).\n\n6. Use `basePath` to specify the location in which to run Compass. Useful for when using grunt with multiple projects with seperate folder structures.\n\n    ```javascript\n    basePath: 'path/to/project/'\n    ```\n\n7. You can set your custom output style like this:\n\n    ```javascript\n    outputstyle: 'compressed'\n    ```\n8. You can disable line comments like this:\n\n    ```javascript\n    linecomments: false\n    ```\n9. If you have multiple compass tasks and you want to force compass compilation you can do this:\n\n    ```javascript\n    forcecompile: true\n    ```\n10. You can require ruby libraries before running commands like this:\n\n    ```javascript\n    require: 'animate-sass'\n    ```\n\n    or\n\n    ```javascript\n    require: [\n      'animate-sass',\n      'mylib'\n    ]\n    ```\n\n11. You can add the `--debug-info` option for use with [FireSass](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firesass-for-firebug/) like so:\n\n    ```javascript\n    debugsass: true\n    ```\n\n12. You can set the relative assets to `true` and set an image path for the Compass spriting feature:\n\n    ```javascript\n    images: '/path/to/images',\n    relativeassets: true\n    ```\n\n13. You can run compass with bundle exec if you need to as well:\n\n    ```javascript\n    bundleExec: true\n    ```\n\n14. If you have a Compass configuration file, you can use it instead of or in addition to the options in your gruntfile:\n\n    ```javascript\n    config: '/path/to/config'\n    ```\n\n    If the path is not absolute, it is relative to the directory containing your gruntfile.\n\n15. If you have a Compass configuration file, you set the environment variable for the config.rb file:\n\n    ```javascript\n    environment: 'production'\n    ```\n\n    Then use it in your config.rb like so:\n\n    ```ruby\n    output_style = ( environment == :production ) ? :compressed : :expanded\n    ```\n\n16. You can add a custom `IMPORT_PATH` folder, which makes files under the path findable by Sass's `@import` directive:\n\n    ```javascript\n    importPath: '/path/to/importPath'\n    ```\n\n17. `grunt compass-clean`\n\n    Sometimes it can be faster to execute `compass clean` and recompile for production instead of doing `--force` compile.\n    Now grunt-compass comes with a `grunt compass-clean` task that you can use when registering prod tasks in your gruntfile like:\n\n    ```js\n    grunt.registerTask( 'prod', [ 'compass-clean', 'compass:prod' ] );\n    ```\n\n18. Run \"grunt watch\" and edit some SASS files :)\n\n# An Example Setup\n\n```javascript\ncompass: {\n    dev: {\n        src: 'assets/scss',\n        dest: 'assets/dev/css',\n        linecomments: true,\n        forcecompile: true,\n        require: [\n          'animate-sass',\n          'mylib'\n        ],\n        debugsass: true,\n        images: '/path/to/images',\n        relativeassets: true\n    },\n    prod: {\n        src: 'assets/scss',\n        dest: 'assets/prod/css',\n        outputstyle: 'compressed',\n        linecomments: false,\n        forcecompile: true,\n        require: [\n          'animate-sass',\n          'mylib'\n        ],\n        debugsass: false,\n        images: '/path/to/images',\n        relativeassets: true\n    }\n}\n```\n\n# Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
